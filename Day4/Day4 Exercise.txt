--Day4 Exercise:

Primary Key:

Table Creation and Insertion:

1.Create a table named Employees with columns: EmployeeID (Primary Key), Name, Age, DepartmentID.
2.Insert some sample data into the Employees table.

Data Retrieval:

1.Write a query to retrieve all records from the Employees table.
2.Write a query to retrieve details of an employee with a specific EmployeeID.
3.Write a query to find the number of employees in each department.

Data Manipulation:

1.Attempt to insert a new employee with a duplicate EmployeeID. Observe the error message.
2.Attempt to update the EmployeeID of an existing employee. Observe the error message.
3.Attempt to delete an employee with a specific EmployeeID.

Foreign Key:

Table Creation and Insertion:

1.Create a table named Departments with columns: DepartmentID (Primary Key), Name.
2.Insert some sample data into the Departments table.
3.Alter the Employees table to add a Foreign Key constraint referencing the DepartmentID column of the Departments table.

Data Retrieval:

1.Write a query to retrieve all employees along with their department names.
2.Write a query to find employees who belong to a specific department.

Data Manipulation:

1.Attempt to insert a new employee with a non-existent DepartmentID. Observe the error message.
2.Attempt to update the DepartmentID of an existing employee to a non-existent value. Observe the error message.
3.Attempt to delete a department that still has employees associated with it.

Default Constraint:

Table Creation and Insertion:

1.Create a table named Students with columns: StudentID (Primary Key), Name, Age with a default constraint of 18 for Age.
2.Insert some sample data into the Students table without specifying the Age.

Data Retrieval:

1.Write a query to retrieve all records from the Students table.
2.Write a query to find students whose age is 18.

Data Manipulation:

1.Attempt to insert a new student without specifying the Age.
2.Attempt to update the Age of an existing student to a NULL value. Observe the behavior of the default constraint.
3.Attempt to insert a new student with a specific Age value.
