Day6 Exercise:

1. Creating Tables with Identity Columns:
   Create a table that stores customer information. Include an identity column as the primary key.

2. Inserting Data with Identity Columns:
   After creating the table, Insert multiple rows of data into the table. Observe how the identity column automatically generates unique values for each row.

3. Applying Unique Constraints:
   Create a table for employee records. Include a unique constraint on the employee ID column to ensure that each employee has a unique identifier.

4. Inserting Data Violating Unique Constraints:
   After creating the employee table with a unique constraint, Attempt to insert duplicate employee IDs into the table. Observe the error message generated by SQL Server when attempting to violate the unique constraint.

5. Altering Identity Columns:
   Alter the identity column properties, such as changing the seed value or increment value, and observe the effects on subsequent inserts.

6. Dropping and Recreating Unique Constraints:
   Drop and Recreate unique constraints on existing tables. Observe how dropping the constraint affects data integrity and how recreating it restores the constraint's enforcement.

7. Composite Unique Constraints:
   Create a table with multiple columns that, together, must be unique. Explore how to define and enforce such constraints.
