--Solve the following Problems:



TCL Questions:

1. Question 1: Suppose you need to update the `TotalAmount` for a specific order (OrderID = 1001) from $150.00 to $180.00. Write a TCL command to perform this update within a transaction.
   
2. Question 2: You've been asked to insert a new order into the `Orders` table with the following details: OrderID = 1005, CustomerID = 101, OrderDate = '2024-03-15', TotalAmount = $210.00. Write a TCL command to execute this insertion within a transaction.
   
3. Question 3: One of the orders (OrderID = 1002) has been canceled, and you need to delete this order from the `Orders` table. Write a TCL command to delete this order within a transaction.

4. Question 4: You've made several updates and insertions in the current transaction but realized there was an error. Write a TCL command to rollback all changes made since the transaction began.

5. Question 5: After ensuring the correctness of the updates and insertions, you want to finalize the transaction. Write a TCL command to commit all changes made within the transaction.

6. Question 6: You need to track all changes made to the `Orders` table during a specific period. Write a TCL command to begin a transaction for tracking purposes.

7. Question 7: After analyzing the changes, you decide to discard the tracked changes and revert the `Orders` table to its original state. Write a TCL command to rollback the transaction used for tracking changes.

DCL Questions:

1. Question 8: You've hired a new employee and want to grant them permission to retrieve data from the `Orders` table. Write a DCL command to grant SELECT permission to the new employee.

2. Question 9: Due to a change in responsibilities, you need to revoke SELECT permission from a specific user who no longer requires access to the `Orders` table. Write a DCL command to revoke SELECT permission from this user.

3. Question 10: As part of a security audit, you've been instructed to ensure that only authorized personnel have the ability to modify data in the `Orders` table. Write a DCL command to grant appropriate permissions for data modification while ensuring data security.
